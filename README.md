# Fantasy-Drafter
I run my fantasy league draft using discord and google sheets (12 team 1qb/2rb/2wr/2flx/1te/8bench 0.5ppr). This is a program that helps me operate slow drafts in my discord server (snake draft format) while simultaneously updating a google sheet with a player board and draft board. When a player is entered on the draft board, his row on the players board will be simultaneously redded out. A copy of the google sheets draft/player board will be included in which the code is meant to be compatible with (format-wise not api-key). The api keys are my own and you must replace with ur own to use it for ur own, and I manually entered the discord Ids of my league/server members. If any future updaters can make it so the members of a league server have their id's automaticlaly included in a list through the api that would be great.

Notes for use: the google sheets also doubles as a database section of the right so make sure that doesn't get altered else the restarts will be wonky (making a compatible sql database will also be a useful update for future use). The app was run on heroku.
