# Fantasy-Drafter
I run my fantasy league draft using discord and google sheets (12 team 1qb/2rb/2wr/2flx/1te/8bench 0.5ppr). This is a program that helps me operate slow drafts in my discord server while simultaneously updating a google sheet with a player board and draft board. A copy of the google sheets draft/player board will be included in which the code is meant to be compatible with (format-wise not api-key). The api keys are my own and you must replace with ur own to use it for ur own, and I manually entered the discord Ids of my league/server members. If any future updaters can make it so the members of a league server have their id's automaticlaly included in a list through the api that would be great.
